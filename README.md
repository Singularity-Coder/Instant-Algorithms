# ‚è± Aymptotic Analysis
* **Asymptotic Analysis Notes** [Link](https://github.com/Singularity-Coder/Code-Snippets-Algorithms/blob/main/assets/notes/AsymptoticAnalysis.pdf)
* Language and metric used to define efficiency of algorithm.
* Asymptotic runtime is a.k.a Big O time.
* Algorithmic runtime example - Large file transfer:
	* Electronic transfer is O(s) time where "s" is file size. Time to transfer file == file size.
	* Airplane transfer is O(1) time as even if the file size increases the time taken to transfer the file remains the same.
* Why constant time is considered better than all? In general, no matter how big the constant and how slow the linear increase, Linear will surpass cosntant time.

# üß† Terminology

## Recursion
* **Recursion Notes** [Link](https://github.com/Singularity-Coder/Code-Snippets-Algorithms/blob/main/assets/notes/Recursion.pdf)
* **Recursion:** Something defined in terms of itself. Ex: 2 = (2 * 2) / 2. Its like iteration without loops. Also means repetition. Its a programming paradigm. Implementation wise, its a function that calls itself. The idea behind recursion is that we solve the main problem by reducing it into smaller subproblems.
* **Iteration:** Repetition of a process.
* **Call stack:** Stack Data Structure that stores info about the active functions/methods/subroutines of a computer program. Also called as execution stack, program stack, control stack, run-time stack, machine stack.
* **Stack Overflow:** A programming error when too much memory is used on the call stack.
* **Base case** Its the final recursive call that actually returns a value which is then computed by the rest of the functions in the call stack. It can also be called as an "exit" condition. A conditon where we quit the recursive call.
* **Memoization or Caching of computed values:** Optimisation technique to speed up running times of programs by storing results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same input occurs again.
* **Dynamic Programming (DP):** An algorithmic technique for optimising a recursive problem by breaking it into subproblems and caching the computed values (memoization) in order to not compute the same subproblem again if it occurs more than once. Refer "Memoization" definition.
* **Ways to solve Recursion / DP problems:**
	* **Bottom-Up:** Solve the problem by first solving the large subproblems using results of smaller subproblems. In-short, solve the simplest case first and build up on that.
	* **Top-Down:** We think about how we can divide the problem for case N into subproblems. Solve the problem by caching solutions to subproblems to avoid recomputing them and reuse those results when required.
	* **Half-and-Half:** Sort array first. Divide data set in half. It's a way to narrow down the data set to find an element quickly. Solve the divided problems and combin the result to solve the main problem.

## Miscellaneous
* **Data:** The quantities, characters or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical or mechanical recording media.
* **Expression:** A function with return value or a variable. They are things that have values. You assign expressions to variables.
* **Statement:** Code with an assignment operator. They are things that have effects. You write statements to assign things to other things.
* **Pascal Case:** KotlinCodeSnippets  
* **Camel Case:** kotlinCodeSnippets  
* **Snake Case:** kotlin_code_snippets 
* **Main Function:** Entry point in our app.  
* **Compiler:** Translates high level language to low level language that machine can understand. Also checks for syntax errors.  
* **Run Kotlin Program:** Converts Kotlin code to Java byte code to run it on JVM. JVM further converts the Java byte code into machine code that <a href=""></a> platform like Mac or Windows can understand.  
* **Statically Typed Programming Language:** Type of a variable is known at compile-time. So once variable is declared with a type, it cannot ever be assigned to a variable of different type and doing so will result in a type error at compile-time. So you CANNOT build the app without fixing the bugs. Fast & Efficient. Ex: Kotlin, Java, C, C++, etc.  
* **Dynamically Typed Programming Language:** Type of a variable is known at run-time. Variables are bound to objects at run-time. You can assign a variable with a different an Integer type even if it was initially assigned String type. So you CAN build the app without fixing the bugs. Slow & less optimized but has its own advantages like dynamic dispatch, late binding, down-casting, reflection. Ex: JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Lisp, etc.  
* **Type Checking:** The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types.  
* **Static check:** Type check happening at compile-time.  
* **Dynamic check:** Type check happening at run-time.  
* **Strongly-typed language:** Variables are bound to specific data types, and will result in type errors if types do not match up as expected in the expression - regardless of when type checking occurs. Ex: Java, Python, etc.  
* **Weakly-typed language:** Variables are not bound to a specific data type; they still have a type, but type safety constraints are lower compared to strongly-typed languages. Ex: PHP, C, C++, etc.  
* **Top-Level function:** A function that is not enclosed in a class.  
* **Double Type:** Double-precision floating-point. More exact than Float numbers.
* **Number System:** A way of representing numbers. The value of any digit in a number can be known if we know:

* Multiple pointer technique:

# Basic Math
* Division: 
	* Ex: 105/8 -> 8 * 13 = 104. What remains of 105 after dividing into 8 parts is 1. Here 105 is Dividend. 8 is the Divisor. 13 is the Quotient. 1 is the Remainder.

* Factor: A number x that divides another number y evenly without leaving a remainder. Ex: 8 is a factor of 32 since 8 divides 32 into 4 equal parts. 
* Common factor: If a number x divides more than 1 number say y and z evenly without leaving a reminder then x is a common factor of y and z. Ex: 2 is a factor of 4 and 8, hence 2 is a common factor.
* GCD (Greatest common divisor) or HCF (Highest common factor): Largest common factor btw 2 or more numbers that divides those numbers evenly without leaving any reminder. Ex: 10 and 15 have 5 as the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a reminder. 10/5 = 2 and 15/5 = 3.
* LCM - Least common multiple
* Find the factors of a number say 35? A.k.a find numbers that divide 35 without leaving a reminder.
